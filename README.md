# dotbproj
A systemd service boot kit for starting vagrant VM or docker containers on system boot

This is Ubuntu-based, tested with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. However, I would expect it works with other Debian-based OS distributions.

If you experience a bug, please file an issue so others can help or submit your PR. Thank you!

## TODO
- [ ] Plugins system so it works with other softwares and other devs can join.
